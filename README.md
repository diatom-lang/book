## Read the book

Online version for the master branch can be found [here](https://diatom-lang.github.io/reference/).

Make sure you have [MdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) installed.  
Run the following script at the repo root.

#### Execute code in the book

Executing scripts relies on wasm module loaded from [Diatom Playground](https://diatom-lang.github.io/diatom-playground/) which requires network access.
